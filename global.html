    <h2><p>IMPACTS ARE</p></h2>
    <h3><p>The environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather. Changes may occur gradually or rapidly. Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations.[190] Since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency.[191] Extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in India and East Asia.[192] Monsoonal precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere has increased since 1980.[193] The rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing,[194] and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming.[195] The frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change.[196]Global sea level is rising as a consequence of thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets. Sea level rise has increased over time, reaching 4.8 cm per decade between 2014 and 2023.[198] Over the 21st century, the IPCC projects 32–62 cm of sea level rise under a low emission scenario, 44–76 cm under an intermediate one and 65–101 cm under a very high emission scenario.[199] Marine ice sheet instability processes in Antarctica may add substantially to these values,[200] including the possibility of a 2-meter sea level rise by 2100 under high emissions.[201]

Climate change has led to decades of shrinking and thinning of the Arctic sea ice.[202] While ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 1.5 °C degrees of warming, they are set to occur once every three to ten years at a warming level of 2 °C.[203] Higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations cause more CO2 to dissolve in the oceans, which is making them more acidic.[204] Because oxygen is less soluble in warmer water,[205] its concentrations in the ocean are decreasing,</p></h3>
